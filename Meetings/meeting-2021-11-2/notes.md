## Meeting Context

- First paper implementation (Shokri's original paper)
- NN-MIA attack based on paper was successful but fairly easy.

## Notes for next session
- [x] Test it on a more generalized model
- [x] Try to train 1 classifier in general, __instead of 1 classifier per class__ 
- [ ] Implement the same attack without supplying attacker with the proba-vector
- [ ] Try attack when some features are missing
- [ ] Further investigate data-synthesis algorithm


## Attack Explained (TODO: Elaborate on the attack further)
