EASY and FAST:

- Try train the attack on dataset with missing features. (closing basic attack)

- plot with 
x : overfit quantification
y : attack score

use cifar 10 model with more data
attack multiple times at different epoch stamps.
Method: 
1. Get the best model with the least overfit 
2. attack the resulting model 
3. record the attack scores
4. train for another k epochs, where k is the epoch factor

BRUTE FORCE TASKS:

- Try the label only - confidence vector attacks comparison in different datasets. (Purchase-10/20/100 datasets, and other datasets with not-image-like data)

- Find papers with MIA and DP (TODO)


NEW IDEAS FOR DIRECTIONS:

- Generate confidence vectors from perturbation prediction divergence vectors. IDEA: train a model with perturbed prediction vectors.

- tune perturbations so that the attack generates the best results. This can be done in a GAN style:


- differential privacy concept:
 make result robust in individual changes of the dataset.
 Queries are not sensitive to changes of one individual point.
 Neighbours in our context: perturbations in our attack. 

 Direction: Try to defend Label only, with DP making the model robust in prediction of perturbed instances. here the 'neighbour' concept is the following
 2 points, where one is perturbation of the other are neighbours.
 2 points in the original dataset, that are not explicitly perturbations of each other are not neighbours.
